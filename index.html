  <h3>
    The usually deep purple roots of <em beetroot> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.
    In fact, <cite Jim Halpert> once said this about beets, <blockquote “Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica”.>
    <q I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.
